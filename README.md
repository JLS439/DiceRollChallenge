# DiceRollChallenge
Simple grouping of two versions of a game I made.  Feel free to download the version that works the best for you!

How to play - C/C++ {
1. Download all files the first time it is to be used.
2. To play, roll the dice by typing 'r' on your keyboard;  Your rolls will ocur from two dice, made using a custom method.
3. If you want to quit at any time, just enter 'q'.  There is no limit to how many times you can play.
4. If you do happrn to press 'q', and exit the game, something special happens:  A randomly generated textual histogram appears, containing data from 60,000 dice rolls of a single die.  Try using this to your advanytage the next time you play!
}
How to play - JAVA {
1. Download all files and compile the 'DiceRoll.java' file the first time the game is to be played.
2. To play, roll the dice by typing 'r' on your keyboard;  Your rolls will ocur from two dice, made using a custom method.
3. In the original c++ version, a seed was used to initialize the random number generator; In JAVA, though, I had to use it for another purpose.  If you're losing, the total may be automatically boosted.  Let's hope it works to your advantage!
4.  If you do happrn to press 'q', and exit the game, something special happens:  A randomly generated textual histogram appears, containing data from 60,000 dice rolls of a single die.  Try using this to your advanytage the next time you play!

Rules - You'll be rolling two dice; a 'lucky seven' has been programmed into the game for a quick win; that is, if you're able to hit it before the Special rounds occur!  Let's just say it sort of becomes an enemy during those...
During the special rounds, you will have to roll the number you obatained at the start of the round to win; Otherwise, if you roll a '7', you lose!
If you're losing in the java version, your seed can be used to boost your total automatically.  If you can use this to your advantage, you may even score a comeback!
